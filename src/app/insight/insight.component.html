    <h1>Insight</h1>
        <p>Throughout these 8 weeks I have learned alot about the SICE program and how to secure a job after college. Alot of the insight from this course came mainly from the morning powerpoint lectures. For example how to make a resume and the TED TALK video, the resume presentation contained alot of information that I didn't know  I needed and the TED TALK was very interesting to listen and learn about how people change in the span of 10 years</p>
        <br />
        <p>Considering I took a BootCamp for JavaScript over the summer which had taught information through a work style environment. I didn't get too much insight over the Design Challenge, however I learned more on what a consultant does. And that process of designing and consulting then engineering can be useful for someone who had not gone through that process before.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The most insightful assignment was the Tech Career Profile. The assignment required research on jobs and the type of skills required for the job. I was also very interested in what that assignemnt had to offer.</p>
