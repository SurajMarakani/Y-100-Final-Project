<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>I thought you were a great teacher. I had learned alot and the class was very interactive. Although my group was not that great. I had fun because of the fantastic engagement you had with the class and the modules on canvas. I want to ask more questions in the future as well mainly regarding my career plans.</p>
